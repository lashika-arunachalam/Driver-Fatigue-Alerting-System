"1 in 25 adult drivers report having passed out behind the wheel within the previous month."
Research have shown that driver drowsiness is a major cause of fatalities all around the globe, raising serious safety concerns on the roadways. If they've ever driven, you've probably fallen asleep at the wheel at least once. Although we don't like to acknowledge it, there is a significant issue with negative effects that must be resolved. Drowsy behaviour is a factor in 1 in 4 vehicle crashes, and 1 in 25 adult drivers say they've dozed off behind the wheel in the previous 30 days. The most terrifying aspect is that sleepy driving goes beyond simply getting unconscious at the wheel. Even a momentary unconsciousness, when the driver is not giving all of their focus on the route, might be considered driving while sleepy. Over 71,000 injuries, 1,500 fatalities, and $12.5 billion in financial damages are caused annually by drowsy driving. Due to the importance of this issue, we think it's critically to provide a sleepiness detection system, particularly in the very beginning of avoiding mishaps. 

Furthermore, we think that being sleepy might have a bad effect on individuals in both job and educational settings. Although sleep deprivation and college go hand in hand, work tiredness, particularly when using substantial equipment, can lead to catastrophic harm, much like when operating while inebriated. Deep learning as well as computer vision technologies have recently demonstrated considerable promise for creating systems like this. It was suggested that a reliable method of identifying fatigue in drivers involves the use of webcams and computational techniques for image processing to identify changes in facial expressions, eye movements, and head position. In particular, the deep learning algorithms known as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in picture categorization and identification applications.

A potential remedy to this issue is to create a detection system that can recognize key signs of sleepiness and send out a warning when it's too late to act.
